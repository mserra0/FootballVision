    "# Football Match Analysis Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive football match analysis system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract detailed insights from a single image or video frame, including:\n",
    "- Player and ball tracking\n",
    "- Team identification\n",
    "- Ball possession analysis\n",
    "- Camera movement tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv5 for identifying players, ball, and referees\n",
    "- **Team Assignment**: Classifies players into teams based on jersey colors\n",
    "- **Ball Tracking**: Interpolates ball trajectory and determines possession\n",
    "- **Camera Movement**: Compensates for camera shifts to maintain accurate tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Workflow\n",
    "1. Load video/image frame\n",
    "2. Detect and track objects\n",
    "3. Assign team colors\n",
    "4. Determine ball possession\n",
    "5. Analyze player movements\n",
    "6. Visualize results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Dependencies\n",
    "- OpenCV for image processing\n",
    "- NumPy for numerical operations\n",
    "- Custom tracking modules for specialized football analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "- Multi-frame video analysis\n",
    "- More sophisticated team and player tracking\n",
    "- Advanced ball possession metrics\n",
    "- Performance optimization"
